## GUI

If you are looking to implement a GUI, I recommend tkinter. Tkinter is considered the fastest and easiest way to use GUI in Python. I would recommend watching the following [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8-snVfekto&ab_channel=KeithGalli) and checking out the following [website](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_gui_programming.htm) to learn more about it.

Here are some important terms to know when using tkinter: 
* root
* Frame
* Label
* Button
* Entry
* relwidth, relheight
* width, height
* relx, rely
* x, y
* command
* lambda
* .place()
* .pack()
* anchor
* font
* bg

If you don't understand them after watching the YouTube video, I would recommend to either conduct some research on them or to contact me <https://github.com/sshmuylovich> before starting to code.

I have also created the file [wimstudy_gui.py](https://github.com/sshmuylovich/wimstudy/blob/main/dashboard/wimstudy_gui.py) to help start your GUI journey!
