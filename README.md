# WimStudy

WimStudy is a revolutionary study aid that provides creative and easily accessible tools to the user.
Designed to maintain focus, set attainable goals, designate time towards specifc taks, and organize various commitments.

The format will seek to provide the user with a dashboard that will cater to the needs of a specifc student, 
their engagements, their productivity levels etc. by collecting data upon each entry. When opened, WimStudy
will inquire as to how much time is available and which task category the user would like to tackle. It will then 
recommend a timer feature and highlight a task. This entry can also be opted out of by the user to allow for a
freestyle study approach.

The dashboard will include a timer, a task list, and a schedule. The timer can be easily manipulated, but can 
also be set to the user's desired intervals. Some recommended templates will also be provided. The task list
will contain the various tasks that need to be accomplished. The items will need to be entered by the user and
can include a description, a due date and be categorized. The schedule will include the items on the task list
that contain a due date and any other events that the user wants to enter. The schedule aims to be visually
appealing and easy to observe.
